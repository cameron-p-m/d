#### d

d is for organization of source files. It organizes things like this `~/src/github.com/[owner]/[repo]` and allows easy naviagtion and cloning in this format.

```
âžœ  d                                                                                                             
usage:
  d <command> [options]
commands:
  cd <target>      navigate
  clone <target>   clone repo
  open pr          open pr on github
  tclone [-name <name>]  create a temp working clone (optional name for branch/dir)
  tclone list        list all temp working dirs (paths)
options:
  -v      verbose output
```

#### install

Only works for zsh for now because that's what I use. Requires HOME env variable.

```
./scripts/install.sh

source ~/.zshrc <- reload shell
```
